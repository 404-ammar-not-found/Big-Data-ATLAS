# Big Data : ATLAS

## Introduction

From 2023 to 2024, I participated in a club supported by [IRIS](https://researchinschools.org/) (The Institute of Research in Schools). I participated in this alongside 4 groupmates:  Viswa Marepalli, Ishir Nama, Joshua Ogbomo and Tobi Ogunlana.

## Project Overview

The aim of ATLAS was to produce a research poster which was presented to academics and peers within London. This paper aims to  to find the invariant mass of the Z<sup>0</sup>  boson, by observing its two primary decay routes, and using data collected by the ATLAS detector to reconstruct the Z<sup>0</sup> boson and calculate its invariant mass, as stated within the research poster. 

Attached in this repo is the research poster in PDF form. 

## Conclusion

This project introduced me to the basics of computational physics and the data processing done to draw conclusions within particle accelerators, enhancing my knowledge of quantum mechanics, data science and computational physics. In addition, it increased my ability to cooperate and organise with group members to produce a academic piece of work.
